Stock Analysis 
# Challenge
In this refractored code it asks for users' input. I made sure the All Stock Analysis worksheet is activated.I have the Range that shows all the stocks depending on the year selected and it is dynamic as per the input. I have the ticker name, daily volume and return as columns. I assigned an array of 12 tickers.also, I have created the arrays  for volumes, starting prices, and ending prices.I have set the tickerIndex to zero before all four loops and tickers are correctly matching across rows.I confirmed that i am not getting any error.The tickerIndex is used to access the correct index across the tickers array and the three output arrays and I rechecked it is giving the correct output.My script includea looping through stock data and it reads and stores all of the following values from each row: tickers, volume, starting prices, ending prices. Lastly I did the formatting to complete the challenge.
